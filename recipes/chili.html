  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Best Classic Chili â€“ This traditional chili recipe is just like mom used to make with ground beef, beans, and a simple homemade blend of chili seasonings. This classic chili is perfect for a weeknight meal because it can be made in minutes.  The only thing to chop is an onion. </p>
